| **price** | **Float** | New fixed price of an item. Value is multiplied by 100 to precisely represent 2 decimal places. For example, a $10 price is written as 1000. In case of the fixed price being calculated by the formula, i.e. the price_formula parameter is present in the fixed price definition, this value becomes the fallback value. Such that in a case where the formula cannot be calculated due to missing metadata, for example, this value will be used as the fixed price. | [optional] |
