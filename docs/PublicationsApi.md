## create_publication

Create Publication

This method selects vouchers that are suitable for publication, adds a publish entry and returns the publication. A voucher is suitable for publication when its active and hasnt been published yet.    🚧 Clearly define the source of the voucher  You must clearly define which source you want to publish the voucher code from. It can either be a code from a campaign or a specific voucher identified by a code.    🚧 Publish multiple vouchers  In case you want to publish multiple vouchers within a single publication, you need to specify the campaign name and number of vouchers you want to publish.    📘 Auto-update campaign  In case you want to ensure the number of publishable codes increases automatically with the number of customers, you should use an **auto-update** campaign.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
  config.api_key['X-App-Id'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Id'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Token
  config.api_key['X-App-Token'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Token'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = VoucherifySdk::PublicationsApi.new
opts = {
  join_once: true, # Boolean | Through this flag, you can control if a particular person gets only one and always the same code even if the app sends multiple publication requests. It means that if you have a referral program, a referrer is assigned only to one code if an integration sends publication requests more than once for the same customer.
  publications_create_request_body: VoucherifySdk::PublicationsCreateRequestBody.new # PublicationsCreateRequestBody | Specify the publication parameters.
}

begin
  # Create Publication
  result = api_instance.create_publication(opts)
  p result
rescue VoucherifySdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling PublicationsApi->create_publication: #{e}"
end
```

Create Publication

This method selects vouchers that are suitable for publication, adds a publish entry and returns the publication. A voucher is suitable for publication when its active and hasnt been published yet.  ❗️ Limited access  Access to this endpoint is limited. This endpoint is designed for specific integrations and the API keys need to be configured to access this endpoint. Navigate to the **Dashboard** &rarr; **Project Settings** &rarr; **General** &rarr; **Integration Keys** to set up a pair of API keys and use them to send the request.    🚧 Clearly define the source of the voucher  You must clearly define which source you want to publish the voucher code from. It can either be a code from a campaign or a specific voucher identified by a code.    🚧 Publish multiple vouchers  This endpoint does not support the publishing of multiple vouchers from a single campaign. In case you want to publish multiple vouchers within a single publication, you need to use a dedicated endpoint.    📘 Auto-update campaign  In case you want to ensure the number of publishable codes increases automatically with the number of customers, you should use an **auto-update** campaign.   # Example Request      ❗️ Required    Query param voucher OR campaign MUST be filled out. If you provide both, campaign param will be skipped.

## list_publications

List Publications

Retrieve a list of publications. To return a **particular** publication, you can use the source_id query parameter and provide the source_id of the publication you are looking for specifically. # Pagination  🚧 Important!  If you want to scroll through a huge set of records, it is recommended to use the Exports API. This API will return an error page_over_limit if you reach a page above 1000. # Filter Query The filters query parameter allows for joining multiple parameters with logical operators. The syntax looks as follows:  ## Operators:  ## Examples
