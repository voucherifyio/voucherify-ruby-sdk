## add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign

> <CampaignsVouchersCreateResponseBody> add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign(campaign_id, code, opts)

Add Voucher with Specific Code to Campaign

This method gives a possibility to add a new voucher to an existing campaign. The voucher definition will be inherited from the definition kept in the campaign profile. However, you are able to overwrite a few properties inherited from the campaign.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
  config.api_key['X-App-Id'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Id'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Token
  config.api_key['X-App-Token'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Token'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = VoucherifySdk::CampaignsApi.new
campaign_id = 'campaign_id_example' # String | The campaign ID or name of the campaign to which voucher will be added. You can either pass the campaign ID, which was assigned by Voucherify, or the name of the campaign as the path parameter value.
code = 'code_example' # String | A custom **code** that identifies the voucher.
opts = {
  campaigns_vouchers_create_request_body: VoucherifySdk::CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody.new # CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody | Specify the voucher parameters that you would like to overwrite.
}

begin
  # Add Voucher with Specific Code to Campaign
  result = api_instance.add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign(campaign_id, code, opts)
  p result
rescue VoucherifySdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling CampaignsApi->add_voucher_with_specific_code_to_campaign: #{e}"
end
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **campaign_id** | **String** | The campaign ID or name of the campaign to which voucher will be added. You can either pass the campaign ID, which was assigned by Voucherify, or the name of the campaign as the path parameter value. |  |
| **code** | **String** | A custom **code** that identifies the voucher. |  |
| **campaigns_vouchers_create_request_body** | [**CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody**](CampaignsVouchersCreateRequestBody.md) | Specify the voucher parameters that you would like to overwrite. | [optional] |

### Return type

### Authorization

## add_vouchers_to_campaign

> <CampaignsVouchersCreateCombinedResponseBody> add_vouchers_to_campaign(campaign_id, opts)

Add Vouchers to Campaign

This method gives the possibility to push new vouchers to an existing campaign. New vouchers will inherit properties from the campaign profile. However, it is possible to overwrite some of them in the request body. If you provide an optional code_config parameter with a voucher code configuration, then it will be used to generate new voucher codes. Otherwise, the voucher code configuration from the campaign will be used. This API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk.  In case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the IN_PROGRESS status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window.  The result will return the async ID. You can verify the status of your request via this API request.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
  config.api_key['X-App-Id'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Id'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Token
  config.api_key['X-App-Token'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Token'] = 'Bearer'
end

api_instance = VoucherifySdk::CampaignsApi.new
campaign_id = 'campaign_id_example' # String | The campaign ID or name of the campaign to which voucher(s) will be added. You can either pass the campaign ID, which was assigned by Voucherify, or the name of the campaign as the path parameter value.
opts = {
  vouchers_count: 56, # Integer | Number of vouchers that should be added.
  campaigns_vouchers_create_in_bulk_request_body: VoucherifySdk::CampaignsVouchersCreateInBulkRequestBody.new # CampaignsVouchersCreateInBulkRequestBody | Specify the voucher parameters that you would like to overwrite.
}

begin
  # Add Vouchers to Campaign
  result = api_instance.add_vouchers_to_campaign(campaign_id, opts)
  p result
rescue VoucherifySdk::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling CampaignsApi->add_vouchers_to_campaign: #{e}"
end
```

### Parameters

## create_campaign

> <CampaignsCreateResponseBody> create_campaign(opts)

Create Campaign

Method to create a batch of vouchers aggregated in one campaign. You can choose a variety of voucher types and define a unique pattern for generating codes.    ðŸ“˜ Global uniqueness  All campaign codes are unique across the whole project. Voucherify will not allow you to generate 2 campaigns with the same coupon code.    ðŸš§ Code generation status  This is an asynchronous action; you cant read or modify a newly created campaign until the code generation is completed. See the creation_status field in the campaign object description.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'VoucherifySdk'
# setup authorization
VoucherifySdk.configure do |config|
  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Id
  config.api_key['X-App-Id'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Id'] = 'Bearer'

  # Configure API key authorization: X-App-Token
  config.api_key['X-App-Token'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
  # Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. 'Bearer' (defaults to nil)
  # config.api_key_prefix['X-App-Token'] = 'Bearer'
end

## delete_campaign

> <CampaignsDeleteResponseBody> delete_campaign(campaign_id, opts)

Delete Campaign

Deletes a campaign and all related vouchers. This action cannot be undone. Also, this method immediately removes any redemptions on the voucher. If the force parameter is set to false or not set at all, the campaign and all related vouchers will be moved to the bin. This API request starts a process that affects Voucherify data in bulk.  In case of small jobs (like bulk update) the request is put into a queue and processed once every other bulk request placed in the queue prior to this request is finished. However, when the job takes a longer time (like vouchers generation) then it is processed in small portions in a round-robin fashion. When there is a list of vouchers generation scheduled, then they will all have the IN_PROGRESS status shortly. This way, small jobs added just after scheduling big jobs of the same type will be processed in a short time window.  The result will return the async ID.

## list_campaigns

> <CampaignsListResponseBody> list_campaigns(opts)

List Campaigns

Retrieve a list of campaigns in a project.  The campaigns are returned sorted by creation date, with the most recent campaigns appearing first.   When you get a list of campaigns, you can optionally specify query parameters to customize the amount of campaigns returned per call using limit, which page of campaigns to return using page, sort the campaigns using the order query parameter and filter the results by the campaign_type. This method will return an error when trying to return a limit of more than 100 campaigns.
