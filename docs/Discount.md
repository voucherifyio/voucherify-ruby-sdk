| **unit_off_formula** | **String** |  | [optional] |
| **unit_type** | **String** | The product deemed as free, chosen from product inventory (e.g. time, items). | [optional] |
| **product** | [**SimpleProductDiscountUnit**](SimpleProductDiscountUnit.md) |  | [optional] |

| **fixed_amount** | **Float** | Sets a fixed value for an order total or the item price. The value is multiplied by 100 to precisely represent 2 decimal places. For example, a $10 discount is written as 1000. If the fixed amount is calculated by the formula, i.e. the &#x60;fixed_amount_formula&#x60; parameter is present in the fixed amount definition, this value becomes the **fallback value**. As a result, if the formula cannot be calculated due to missing metadata, for example, this value will be used as the fixed value. | [optional] |
